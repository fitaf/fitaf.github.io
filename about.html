    <h1>FITAF (Fury In The Accounting Factory)</h1>
    <h3>Vision/Advantages/Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Go into a shop and after selecting goods, say to the cashier: “Payment with FITAF 258" (ID of company) -> No manual payment & no manual book keeping - best case: both sides</li>
      <li>FITAF "way of payment" for immediate processing within the FITAF System -> no classical money movement B2B</li>
      <li>Automatic payments & book keeping</li>
      <li>Ensuring and processing of payments in "real-time" (also on weekends!) [“FITAF-Debit”]</li>
      <li>Suggestions for book keeping accounts based on:
        <ol>
          <li>Bookings in the past</li>
          <li>The invoice giver or invoice taker (=the other party on the invoice | bascially the company (giber/taker) providing the invoice)</li>
          <li>Other companies (3rd parties)</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Reporting aiming for managers (not book keepers)</li>
      <li>Payment clearing among all parties -> no classical money movement B2B</li>
      <li>International payment clearing across currencies -> no classical money movement B2B</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>About the founder....ääääh...thats me :-)</h3>
    <p>I was 6 years CTO, CFO & CEO before of a founded & venture capital financed (10m+€) tech company in travel.</p>
    <p>After being in university (diploma/master information science), I was strategy consultant for IT managers before I founded the company. Actually I did a lot of IT-Controlling of a ~3bn €/year budget</p>
    <br>
    <p>I am the "angry" guy in the team. Yeah, the name "fury" comes from somewhere :-).<br><br>
       I am personally offended by accounting. I HATE how the world worldide has implemented a secure but highly ineffective and ineffectives system globally. No joke. But good for you I guess :-D.<br><br>
       E.g. to explain my nature: I hate putting words with pens on corpses of dead plants a.k.a. paper while we have fully digital means. Some people call me a digitalization nerd. :-)
