    <h1>I believe in shares!</h1>
    <p>
      We want every employee to participate as shareholder to every discussion we have.
      So every full time employee gains 2 share units every month (interns and working studentes 1).
      
      At a potential exit you can make the share units to sahres to to money.
      Legally your shares are immeaditely bought and sold at eit.
      To minimize legal friction.
      
      The amount os sshares is more than 3x as big as in my old company.
      
      The "virtual share program" doesnt transfer company decision rights to you.
