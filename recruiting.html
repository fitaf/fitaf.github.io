    <h1>I believe in shares!</h1>
    <p>
      We want every employee to participate as a shareholder to every discussion we have.
      
      So every full time employee gains 2 share units every month (interns and working studentes 1).
      
      At a potential exit you can make money via: share units -> shares -> money
      
      Legally your shares are immeaditely bought and sold at exit (primarily  
      to minimize legal and income tax friction).
      
      The amount of shares is more than 3x as big as in my old company.
      
      (This "virtual share program" doesnt transfer company decision rights to you, which you would get as real shareholder)
