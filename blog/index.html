        CARAMELOW
        <p>
          Just imagine you have an invoicing app. For sake of simpicity lets call it CARAMELOW.
          You have a 2-sided market with a) suppliers and b) merchants.
          <br>
          But you do technical stuff for both sides (e.g. a marketplace in the web) hence you also generate the invoices for both sides.
          <br>
          In case of a supplier (the [invoice-giver]) you and the supplier the (the [invoice- taker]). Vice Versa for Merchants.
          <br>
          Every month you conduct invoicing for both sides. You are sending eMails to respective parties.
          <br>
          Process today without FITAF:
        </p>  
        <ol>
          <li>Open CARAMELOW</li>
          <li>log into CARAMELOW(could be skipped with endurable log-ins)</li>
          <li>Download the invoice</li>
          <li>Open your browser</li>
          <li>Open your web-mailer</li>
          <li>Create new email</li>
          <li>Put recipient in to field</li>
          <li>Put your tax consultant in CC field</li>
          <li>Write text</li>
          <li>Attach File</li>
          <li>Press "Send"</li>
          <li>Imagine your E-Mail is received immeaditely (which practically is never the case!!!!)</li>
          <li>Customer forwards to his tax consultant>/li>
          <li>Your tax consultant reads your e-Mails</li>
          <li> ...and does his bookings in accouning</li>
          <li>The taker's tax cunsultant also procceses the attachments</li>
          <li>The head of payments sets up a payment for you with the right value</li>
          <li>You check the height & execute the payment</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          You decide to call the "FITAF invoiving API" via a schedule job.
          By this CARAMELO triggerers automated send-outs and conducts automated book keeping on your side (in theory both sides).
          You hope that FITAF soon implements internetional payment clearing to also reduce the efforts for you there too.
          (IT Development Effort = approx. 1 day with testing)
        </p>  
        <br>
        <p>Process with FITAF (with international payment clearing!)</p>
        <ol>
          <li>All automated :-D . 1 step instead of 20 and no manual work? Really?</li>
        </ol>  
        <br>

        <p>
          Because you are so grateful you invite the FITAF CEO for dinner :-D
          Really? Thanks-a-ton!
