      <li>CARAMELO</li>
      <p>
        Just imagine you have an invoicing app. For sake of simpicity lets call it CARAMELO. You have a 2-sided market with a) suppliers and b) merchants
        <br>
        But you do technical stuff for both sides (e.g. a marketplace in the web) hence you also generate the invoices for both sides.
        <br>
        In case of a supplier the [invoice giver] is you and the supplier the [invoice taker]. Vice Versa for Mechants.
        <br>
        Every month you conduct invoicing for both sides. You are sending eMails to respective parties.
        <br>
        Process today without FITAF:
      </p>  
      <ol>
        <li>Open CARAMELO</li>
        <li>Download the invoice</li>
        <li>Open your browser</li>
        <li>Open your web-mailer</li>
        <li>Create new email</li>
        <li>Put recipient in to field</li>
        <li>Put your tax condultant in CC field</li>
        <li>Write text</li>
        <li>Attach File</li>
        <li>Press "Send"</li>
        <li>Imagine your E-Mail is received immeaditely (which in reality is never the case!!!!)</li>
        <li>Customer forwards to his tax consultant>/li>
        <li>Your tax consultant reads your e-Mails</li>
        <li> ...and does his bookings in accouning</li>
        <li>His tax cunsultant also procceses the attachments</li>
        <li>The head of payments setups the payment for you.</li>
        <li>You execute the paayments & check the height of the payment<li>
      </ol>
        
      <p>
        You decide to call the "FITAF invoiving API" and by this trigger send outs and book keeping on yourboth sides. You hope th11at FITAF soon does internetional payment clearing.
