      <li>CARAMELO</li>
      <p>
        Just imagine you have an invoicing app. For sake of simpicity lets call it CARAMELO. You have a 2-sided market with a) suppliers and b) merchants
        <br>
        But you do technical stuff for both sides (e.g. a marketplace in the web) hence you also generate the invoices for both sides.
        <br>
        In case of a supplier the [invoice giver] is you and the supplier the [invoice taker]. Vice Versa for Mechants.
        <br>
        Every month you conduct invoicing for both sides. You are sending eMails to respective parties.
        <br>
        You decide to call the "FITAF invoiving API" and by this trigger send outs and book keeping on xour side. You hope that FITAF soon does internetional payment clearing.
        IT Development Effort = One ay with testing.
        <br>
        Because you are so grateful you invite the FITAF CEO for dinner :-D
