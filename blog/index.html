    <br/>

    <p>
      You can't believe your company since existence did some kind of "donkey work". Thinking about it - this is actually what it is!
      No human interaction (-> !!!) needed.
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="1">CARAMELOW</h2>
    
    <p>
      Just imagine you have an invoicing app. For sake of simpicity lets call it CARAMELOW.
      You have a 2-sided market with a) suppliers and b) merchants.
      <br/>
      Because invoicing is quite complex and you do technical stuff for both sides (e.g. a marketplace in the web) hence you all decided that you will generate the invoicesyou generate invoices for both sides you have agreed.
      <br/>
      In case of a supplier (the [invoice-giver]) you are the [invoice- taker]. Vice Versa for Merchants.
      <br/>
      Every month you conduct invoicing for both sides & are sending eMails to respective parties.
      <br/>
      Process steps today without FITAF:
    </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Open CARAMELOW</li>
        <li>Log into CARAMELOW (could be skipped with endurable web log-ins, mostly Cookie based)</li>
        <li>Download the invoice</li>
        <li>Open your browser</li>
        <li>Open your web-mailer</li>
        <li>Create new email</li>
        <li>Put recipient in to field</li>
        <li>Put your tax consultant in CC field</li>
        <li>Write text</li>
        <li>Attach File</li>
        <li>Press "Send"</li>
        <li>Imagine your E-Mail is received immeaditely (which practically is never the case!!!!)</li>
        <li>Customer forwards to his tax consultant>/li>
        <li>Your tax consultant reads your e-Mails</li>
        <li> ...and does his bookings in accouning</li>
        <li>The taker's tax cunsultant also procceses the attachments</li>
        <li>The head of payments sets up a payment for you with the right value</li>
        <li>You check the height & execute the payment</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        You decide to call the "FITAF invoiving API" via a schedule job.
        By this CARAMELO triggerers automated send-outs and conducts automated book keeping on your side (in theory both sides).
        (IT Development Effort = approx. 1 day with testing)
        <br/>
        You hope that FITAF soon implements internetional payment clearing to also reduce the efforts for you there too.      
      </p>  
      <br/>
    
      <h2>Process with FITAF (with international payment clearing!)</h2>

      <p>No manual steps - all automated! Really? Great! :-)</p>
      <br/>
      <p>

        "Theats me! Really? Thanks-a-ton!" :-D
